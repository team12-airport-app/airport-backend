Team12 (Stephen Morrison, Chris Morrison) Airport Backend — Flight Management API

Spring Boot (Java 21) + MySQL 8 backend for the Team12 airport app.
Supports read-only “boards” (Q1–Q4 endpoints from the assignment), plus an Admin surface to manage entities. Designed to be consumed by the Vite React frontend running on port 5137.
Stack

    Java 21 (Temurin)

    Spring Boot + Spring Data JPA + Validation

    MySQL 8.0.42 (Dockerized locally)

    Maven Wrapper (./mvnw)

    Postman collection for manual/runner tests

    GitHub Actions CI (build + tests on PR)

Local Dev Quickstart
Prereqs

    Java 21 (Temurin recommended)

    Docker + Docker Compose

    MySQL runs via Docker (see below)

    Postman (recommended for assignment tests)

Environment

The app reads DB config from OS environment variables (no hard-coded creds):

DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3307
DB_NAME=flight_management
DB_USER=airport_app
DB_PASSWORD=AirportApp2025!
SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=local

macOS/zsh note: quote the bang when exporting
export DB_PASSWORD='AirportApp2025!'
Start DB (Docker)

We map host 3307 → 3306 in the container and set the timezone to America/St_Johns.

docker compose up -d
# or: docker-compose up -d

This creates:

    DB: flight_management

    User: airport_app / AirportApp2025!

    Root: random (unused)

Run the API

# *nix
./mvnw -q clean test
./mvnw spring-boot:run

# Windows PowerShell
.\mvnw.cmd -q clean test
.\mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run

The API will be at http://localhost:8080.

CORS is enabled for http://localhost:5137 (frontend).
Postman — Collection & Runner Order

Collection file: postman/FlightManagement.postman_collection.json
It includes the original Q1–Q4 plus Admin CRUD for Airports, Airlines, and Gates.
Import

    Open Postman → Import → select the JSON file above.

    In Collection Variables, ensure:

        baseUrl = http://localhost:8080

        airportCode = YYT (can be overridden by the Airports list step)

One-Click Runner Order (copy/paste for TAs)

Run these in this exact order (once). Everything is self-contained and uses dynamic variables; no manual edits needed.

    Q1 GET /cities → Captures testCityId.

    Q2 GET /aircraft-with-passengers → Validates 200 + array.

    Q3a GET /aircraft-with-airports → Captures aircraftId.

    Q3b GET /aircraft/{{aircraftId}}/flights → Validates flights list.

    Q4 GET /passengers-with-airports → Validates 200 + array.

Airports (Admin CRUD)
6. List Airports (/manage/airports) → Sets airportCode if empty.
7. Create Airport (POST /manage/airports) → Captures createdAirportId, airportCode.
8. Get Airport by ID (GET /manage/airports/{{createdAirportId}}).
9. Update Airport (PUT /manage/airports/{{createdAirportId}}).
10. Delete Airport (DELETE /manage/airports/{{createdAirportId}}).

Airlines (Admin CRUD)
11. List Airlines (/manage/airlines).
12. Create Airline (POST /manage/airlines) → Captures createdAirlineId, createdAirlineCode.
13. Get Airline by ID (GET /manage/airlines/{{createdAirlineId}}).
14. Update Airline (PUT /manage/airlines/{{createdAirlineId}}).
15. Delete Airline (DELETE /manage/airlines/{{createdAirlineId}}).

Gates (Admin CRUD + filter)
16. List Gates (/manage/gates).
17. Create Gate (POST /manage/gates) → Captures createdGateId, createdGateCode (uses airportCode).
18. List Gates by Airport (GET /manage/gates?airport={{airportCode}}).
19. Get Gate by ID (GET /manage/gates/{{createdGateId}}).
20. Update Gate (PUT /manage/gates/{{createdGateId}}).
21. Delete Gate (DELETE /manage/gates/{{createdGateId}}).

Expected statuses: 200 for GET/PUT, 201 for POST (204 or 200 for DELETE).
If a step fails: ensure the API is running on http://localhost:8080 and that you haven’t skipped earlier steps that set variables.
API Surface (current + PR A additions)
Assignment/Reports (existing)

    GET /cities

    GET /aircraft-with-passengers

    GET /aircraft-with-airports

    GET /aircraft/{id}/flights

    GET /passengers-with-airports

Admin — Airports (existing)

    GET /manage/airports

    GET /manage/airports/{id}

    POST /manage/airports

    PUT /manage/airports/{id}

    DELETE /manage/airports/{id}

Admin — Airlines (PR A)

    GET /manage/airlines

    GET /manage/airlines/{id}

    POST /manage/airlines

    PUT /manage/airlines/{id}

    DELETE /manage/airlines/{id}

Admin — Gates (PR A)

    GET /manage/gates

    GET /manage/gates/{id}

    GET /manage/gates?airport={code}

    POST /manage/gates

    PUT /manage/gates/{id}

    DELETE /manage/gates/{id}

    Notes:

        Airline code is unique (e.g., AC, WS, PD).

        Gate code is unique per airport (e.g., YYT A7, A8, …).

Profiles & Data

    local: connects to the Dockerized MySQL (env-driven).

    Seeders may add baseline demo data for cities, airports, aircraft, and flights (conditional inserts; won’t overwrite manual entries).

CI

    GitHub Actions build & test on PR to main.

    All PRs must be from a feature branch, reviewed by the other teammate, and pass CI before merge.

Branching & Workflow

    Short-lived feature branches (e.g., feat/airlines-gates).

    Open an Issue first so it auto-adds to the Org Project Board.

    Commit style: feat(api): …, fix(db): …, chore(ci): ….

    No direct pushes to main.

Frontend Integration Notes

    Frontend runs at http://localhost:5137.

    Make sure CORS allows this origin (already configured).

    Frontend consumes:

        Airports list for the switcher

        (Soon) Arrivals/Departures board endpoints

        Admin: Airports / Airlines / Gates / Flights

Troubleshooting

    CORS: If browser blocks requests from 5137, confirm allowed origin in the global CORS config.

    MySQL auth: Ensure env vars are exported in the same terminal where you run spring-boot:run.

    Windows JAVA_HOME: If needed, set it with setx or configure via Adoptium installer.

    Ports: DB 3307 on host must be free. Stop local MySQL if it conflicts.rport Backend
